Phenomenological Robotics - Outline

1. Justify looking at phenomenology of perception ideas in order to build better
robots.
  1.A. "Failure" of the computational hypothesis on everyday coping (being in
  the world is more basic than thinking).
  1.B. Adequability of the phenomenology of perception theories: Heidegger,
  Merleau-Ponty, Noë.
  1.C. Relation to affordances.
  1.D. Robots in human environments.
  1.E. Robots have different bodies, different perceptions and different needs
  from ours.
  1.F. Working in unstructured environments require a close-to-human
  intelligence.

2. Relation between phenomenology and alternative psychology theories.
  2.A. Heidegger vs. Affordances vs. Agre (no learning) vs. Freeman vs. Noë vs.
  Chemero vs. Heft.
  2.B. Merleau-Ponty skills (refined situations) vs. Eleanor Gibson.
  2.C. Merleau-Ponty vs. Coupling (van Gelder) vs. Stepp vs. Freeman.
  2.D. EST vs. Freeman (discrete basin transitions).
  2.E. Merleau-Ponty (demand) vs. Chemero.
  2.F. Froese and Ziemke: autonomy plus adaptivity vs. precarity.

3. In Robotics, Phylosophy and Related Work.
  3.A. Kuipers vs. Todes.
  3.B. Bottom-up vs. TCP/IP vs. Small-world models.
  3.C. Check Estela Bicho's work.
  3.D. Review Winograd and Flores (09/03/2011) about action and perception
  (hermeneutic circle).

4. The IKEA scenario.
