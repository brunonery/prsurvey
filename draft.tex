In the world of Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI), scientists
attempted to fabricate intelligence by doing inference on symbolic
representations of the world. In Brooks \cite{brooks91} approach, this is done
by making agents respond to fixed isolable features of the environment.

Dreyfus \cite{dreyfus07} believes that the basis of human intelligence, coping
with everyday life, cannot be achieved by any of the approaches described above.
Instead, the fact that

\dots embodied beings like us take as input energy from the physical universe
and respond in such a way as to open them to a world organized in terms of their
needs, interests, and bodily capacities, without their minds needing to impose
meaning on a meaningless given \dots nor their brains converting stimulus input
into reflex responses \dots
